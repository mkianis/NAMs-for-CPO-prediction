# NAMs-for-CPO-prediction
Prediction of celestial pole offsets using neural additive models

The prediction files provided are based on the format of second EOPPCC, which is currently the format of the files we provide on [our geodetic prediction center at ETH Zurich](https://gpc.ethz.ch/EOP/).
The predictions of celestial pole offsets are at the columns 8 (for dX) and 9 (for dY). The units are milliarcseconds. The prediction time is provided at the first column in terms of modified Julian date.
